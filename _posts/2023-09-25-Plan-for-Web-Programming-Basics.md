Since this is the last plan for Sprint2, there is also a rubric/checklist for me to follow:

## Each Hack
- .5 point: Have a working HTML code cell in a notebook based on the wireframe representation provided under HTML hacks (HTML Hack)
- .5 point: Have a working javascript code cell in a notebook based on the instructions provided under data types hacks (Data Types Hack)
- .5 point: Have a working javascript code cell in a notebook which modifies elements in the first HTML code cell hack or another HTML code cell based on the same wireframe representation (DOM Hack)
- .5 point: Have a working javascript code cell in a notebook based on the instructions provided in the javascript hack (Javascript Hack)
- .5 point: Have code cells in a notebook which shows the corrections made to the first three code cells in the 1.4 correcting errors page (Correcting Errors Hack)

## Reviews and Scoring
- 1 point: Have all of the different notebooks and cells made working in their own individual GitHub Pages with utterances and reviewers comments
- .5 point: Make a summary review ticket based on the Total Test and utterances. Have a total of the other peopleâ€™s scores that they collaborated with on the test
