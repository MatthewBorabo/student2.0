# Background
So I'm behind since I haven't updated my repo to be like the group one. I need to implement the mario game into the frontpage ASAP. I will be working on this all night. For now, here's my checklist and status:

- Complete all the reflections and warm-ups of each week (Weeks 13-15)
- Get back all of the files that are essential to the Mario Game
- Implement the game to the personal repo (student2.0)

# Next:
- Implement the Goomba into the personal repo (and group repo)
- Mess around with the Goomba
- IMPORTANT: Help Trystan and Ian with the LocalStorage lesson

# Estimated Time: 5 Hours
- Wish me luck! Matthew (12/6)
