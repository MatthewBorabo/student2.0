    "- HTML: I was able to set up the code and it matches the wireframe, so I believe I got the 0.5 points.\n",
    "- Data Types: I was able to successfully enter my object which represents the components of my life. I was also able to add math to the code as well and perform mathematical operations. I most likely got the 0.5 points.\n",
    "- DOM: I was able to make the code. However, I wasn't able to execute the code to my liking so I don't believe I got the 0.5 points here.\n",
    "- JavaScript: This one was mostly simple as it is comparing 2 variables with each other. I believe I got the 0.5 points.\n",
    "- JS Debugging: This one was pretty fun. I was able to fix the segments and added what I changed. I did not do the challenge however. I believe I got the 0.5 points here.\n",
