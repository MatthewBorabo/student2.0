    "I am planning to work on the functionality of the main menu and the starting menu in general. In order to be functional, when I press play, it will show the play menu which shows more options/buttons. When I press credits, it will show who worked on the game and some descriptions. If possible, I can code an on/off sound button and \"full screen\". I may work on other stuff such as lore. Despite it not being a crucial part of the game, I need to find a way to become attached to the game so I can increase my focus and output. I will only do this if I really can't focus on coding. I may add more to this later.\n",

    "For context, I'm going to be working on the main menu and Ian is going to be working on making the animation walk. We can check each other's progress to ensure that both of us are not falling behind. This is mostly for accountability. If one of us needs help, we can check each other's code and work together on the main menu or animation. I can also help Gavin and John if they require my help with anything.\n",
